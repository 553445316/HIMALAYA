# HIMALAYA  
The HIMALAYA pipeline is specifically designed for the EOR foreground removal of SDC3 data. To execute the code, use the command line "python pipe_HIMALAYA.py i nx," where 'i' and 'nx' are integers. Select 'i' from the range [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] to choose the frequency bin, and 'nx' represents the size of the cropped image. In my submitted results, I used 'nx=256' to minimize the primary beam effect while slightly increasing the error bar.  Before running the main pipeline, execute 'split_data.py' to divide all the MSN fits files into 6 frequency bins as required. Ensure that the resulting NPY files are placed in the directory "sdc3-images/npy". Additionally, make sure to place all tested data released by SDC3 in the directory "sdc3-images/test-data".  The 2D power spectra and their corresponding errors, once recovered, are stored in the 'sdc3-images/plot' directory.
